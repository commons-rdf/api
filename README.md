# Commons RDF

Working repository for experimenting with idea of providing a common library for [RDF 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) that could be implemented by the upcoming versions of the main Java toolkits ([Jena](http://jena.apache.org) 3.0 and [Sesame](http://openrdf.callimachus.net) 4.0) as well as wrappers for other JVM languages ([Banana RDF](https://github.com/w3c/banana-rdf) and so on).

The main motivation behind this simple library is revise an historical incompatibility issue. This library does not pretend to be a generic api wrapping those libraries, but a set of interfaces for the RDF 1.1 concepts that can be used to expose common RDF-1.1 concepts using common Java interfaces. In the initial phase commons-rdf is focused on a subset of the core concepts defined by RDF-1.1 (IRI, Blank Node, Literal, Triple, and Graph). In particular, commons RDF aims to provide a type-safe, non-general API that covers RDF 1.1. In a future phase we may define interfaces for Datasets and Quads.

## Status

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/commons-rdf/commons-rdf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/commons-rdf/commons-rdf)

This library is still work in progress.

A draft diagram of the interfaces which may be included in Commons RDF are:

## Building

Building has been tested with [Apache Maven 3.2](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [Java JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/).

To then use from your project, add to Maven (update `<version>` to match the Maven output):

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.commons-rdf</groupId>
        <artifactId>api</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
    
    
### Java 6 compatibility

This API is targetting *Java 8*, as Java 7 is scheduled [EOL at April 2015](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/eol-135779.html).

For convenience, a patched version for Java 6 and 7 is however available.

To build with Java 1.6/1.7 compatibility, use the `java6` Maven profile:

    $ mvn clean install -Pjava6

To then depend on the Java 6 version in your Maven project, you need to use a special `classifier` to the dependency:

    <classifier>java6</classifier>

Note that the Java 6 version depends on the [Guava libraries](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) for providing the missing features.
